# Course Policies

## Switching Sections

You are expected to attend the section you are officially signed up for. That is where your attendance will be recorded. 
- We do not allow **_unofficial_** section switching. 
- If you can't officially change your section through the registrar, we can't help either!

> Try posting (during the first week of classes only) on social media group to check if someone is willing to swap sections with you. If there is a pair willing to swap sections, we can help by reaching out to the registrar.

## Missing the Midterm Exam

You are entitled to a make-up exam if you miss the midterm exam, provided that:
- You provide a valid excuse.
- You inform your instructor **_within 3 days_** of the exam or the date of your medical report.

> Valid Excuses
>
> According to university regulations, a valid excuse is a medical report from a doctor (approved by the the university's medical center) or a note from a Dean justifying your absence.

## Missing the Final Exam

If you miss the final exam, you need to request a make-up exam and provide a valid excuse through the online registration portal. All requests for make-up final exams are handled by the Dean, not by the course instructor. The report must be submitted through the system **_within 7 days_** of the final exam.

## Missing Other Coursework

If you have a **_valid excuse_** preventing you from submitting self-assessment quiz for a certain week, reach out to your instructor and ask for the quiz to be rescheduled for the following week.
