# Frequently Asked Questions

## Studying for this course

<div class="faq-page">
<details class="jtd-accordion">
  <summary>How do you suggest I study for this course?</summary>
  Make sure that you do the following every week:
  <ol>
    <li><b>Read the assigned material</b> (from the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/notes">Course Notes</a> page) and make sure you understand it. Go to office hours and ask questions if you have difficulty understanding something.</li>
    <li><b>Work on the weekly practice exercises</b> over the weekend. Make it your goal to understand these exercises in whatever way you can (thinking and trying hard, asking your friends, going to office hours, etc.)</li>
    <li><b>Reaching out for help.</b> At the beginning of the following week, make it your goal to resolve any issues you faced while studying the previous week's material and when working on the practice exercises.</li>
  </ol>

  This requires good time management. If you manage to follow the read (during the week), solve (over the weekend), ask (at the beginning of the following week) cycle, you should be in good shape!

  <summary>My classmate already knows a lot of programming. I feel I'm already behind! </summary>
  Don't worry. You are normal, and they are the exception.<br>
  Keep in mind that this course is designed for students like <i>you</i>. Therefore, focus on learning the material according to the schedule set in this course, and don't be let down by others who might be ahead of you, not because they are better, but because they have seen this material somewhere else. <br>Your measure for success should not be whether you are better/faster than others in learning, but should be whether you are meeting the course goals or not.

  <summary>I already know a lot of programming. This course is too easy for me. </summary>
  Great! This is good news, not bad news. This means that you can get good grades in the course and work more on improving your skills in programming. Here are a few notes.
  <ul>
    <li><b>Check the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/resources">Resources</a> page</b>. There are a ton of things for you there to improve your programming skills.</li>
    <li><b>Help others</b>. Students might ask questions on social media groups. Your expertise is needed in answering student questions.</li>
    <li><b>Be respectful of others</b>. It can be easy to (unintentionally) put others off by making them feel inferior. Be conscious about how you answer and ask questions during lectures, or when students seek your help!</li>
  </ul>

<details class="jtd-accordion">
  <summary>Can I move to another section? </summary>
  Yes, if you can do that officially through the deanship of admission and registration. Otherwise, No (see the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/policies">policies</a> page).
</details>

<details class="jtd-accordion">
  <summary>I don't want to move permanently to another section, but I need to attend one or two lectures in another section. </summary>
  Your attendance will be recorded in the section you are officially signed up for. However, if you know you are going to miss your section's lecture but want to make them lecture up with another section (so that you don't miss the material), you can reach out to the instructor of the section you want to attend and ask them if you can attend. See the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/staff">Staff</a> page to know which instructors teach which sections.
