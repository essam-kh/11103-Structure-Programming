## Course Overview

Welcome! This course is designed to take you from the basics of code to a deep understanding of how programs work. As you solve problems week by week, you will build the critical thinking skills necessary for advanced fields like software engineering and system design. In short, this course is where you stop just using software and start understanding how to build it.
## Prerequisites

Zero prior experience is expected. Success in this course relies on three things: your curiosity to learn new systems, your consistency in practicing the material, and your perseverance in solving complex problems. Bring your focus, and we will handle the rest.

## Textbook

We will use the following textbook. We will also use slides, notes, and other resources as necessary.

## Course Topics

The first few weeks of the semester will focus on the fundamentals of C programming, including memory concepts, arithmetic, functions, selection statements, loops, and arrays. Each of the remaining weeks will explore advanced topics such as sorting, 2D arrays, recursion, and pointers. Here is what you should expect to achieve by the end of the semester:

- Be able to **analyze and solve** computational problems using core C programming concepts including variables, control structures, and functions.
- Be able to **implement and manipulate** data structures such as 1D/2D arrays and strings for data processing.
- Be able to **apply advanced techniques** including recursion and pointers to write efficient and modular code.
- Be able to **design and debug** complete C programs using modern development tools.
